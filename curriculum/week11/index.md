### Schedule

  - [Study](#study-plan-NN)
  - [Exercises](#exercises-NN)
  - [Extra Resources](#extra-resources-NN)

### Study Plan

  - [Read: **Introduction to JSON**](../modules/javascript/core/json/30-days-of-javascript/index.md){:target="_blank"}

### Summary

  üåï You are extraordinary. You know a light-weight data format which you may use to store data or to send it an HTTP server. Now do some exercises for your brain and for your muscle.

### Exercises

  **JSON Basics**

  Copy the folder `curriculum/week11/exercises/json_basics/` inside folder `user/week11/exercises/day01/` and compete all the challenges found inside the JavaScript file.

  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheet for this day is: **/user/week11/progress/progress.draft.w11.d01.csv**

  You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../week01/resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).
