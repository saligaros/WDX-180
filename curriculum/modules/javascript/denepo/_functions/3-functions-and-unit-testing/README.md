# Functions & Unit Testing

Learn to trace functions, and to check a function's behavior with unit tests.

## Before Class

- Asserting: study the chapter `0-asserting` in this repository.
  - use `console.assert` to predict values in memory at different steps of
    execution
- [Functions in 90 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY182o4J5_Y)
- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/function-basics)
- Coding Train:
  - [Function Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHAitGzBrg)
  - [Parameters & Arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkc417YapfE)
  - [Functions & Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRnUBiTJ66Y)

The examples and exercises in this repository all use `() => {}` (arrow
functions), while many resources online cover `function` functions. Why? Because
arrow functions are simpler to study in the debugger. That's all you need to
know for now!

## Learning Objectives

- ü•ö **Defining vs. Calling**: You can explain the difference between _defining_
  and _calling_ a function , and you can find both in a program.
- ü•ö **Tracing Functions**: You can trace a program that uses programs using
  trace tables and a step debugger.
- ü•ö **Arguments, Parameters, Return Values**: While tracing a function call you
  can explain the difference between an _argument_, a _parameter_ and a _return
  value_.
- üê£ **Reading Documentation**: You can read a JS Doc comment to understand what
  a function should do.
- üê£ **Writing Documentation**: You can write a JS Doc comment to describe a
  working function.
- üê• **Reading Unit Tests**: You can read unit tests and their output to
  understand what a function is supposed to do.
- üê• **Passing Unit Tests**: You can use unit test output to help you write a
  passing function.

## During Class

### Before Break

- **All together:** `1-functions/examples`
- **In Small Groups:**
  - `1-functions/exercises`
  - `2-documenting-functions` (as far as you can make it)
- **All Together:** Regroup with ~20 minutes left before break for each group to
  do a quick retro

### After Break

- **All together:** `3-testing-functions/examples`
  - in VSCode using `npm run test -- ./path/to/file.test.js`
  - or in the browser using study lenses
- **In Small Groups:**
  - `3-testing-functions/exercises`
  - finish `2-documenting-functions` if you have time
- **All Together:** Regroup with ~20 minutes left before break for each group to
  do a quick retro

## After Class

Keep working your way through the exercises in this repo and your favorite
online tutorials.

You have already seen some of the material in the first chapters. Instead of
rushing through it, take this chance to review the basics before moving forward.
This will save you time in the long run.

If you only make it as far as _Control Flow_ that's ok!
