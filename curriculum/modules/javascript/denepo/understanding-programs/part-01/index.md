### Study Plan

  This Module is about "Understanding Programs". It's not enough just to know the language features in JS. Before you can write good programs you need to learn how to understand code that you did not write. The following module contains a handful of sections that provide you a good amount of JavaScript programs and a lot of tools,methods and good practices on how to properly understand programs written by others!

  Make sure to follow the guides on **Setting up Study Lenses (v2) on your System** and **Launching Study Lenses and following the material** from [Week 07 Day 01](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/curriculum/week07/){:target="_blank"} and then go through the following sections:

  - **0-let-vs-const**
  - **1-predicting-execution**
  - **2-reading-programs**
