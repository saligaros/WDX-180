# Fetch API and Async/Await

## Fetch API

The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set. In this challenge we will use fetch to request url and APIS. In addition to that let us see demonstrate use case of promises in accessing network resources using the fetch API.

```js
const url = 'https://restcountries.com/v2/all' // countries api
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json()) // accessing the API data as JSON
  .then(data => {
    // getting the data
    console.log(data)
  })
  .catch(error => console.error(error)) // handling error if something wrong happens
```

## Async and Await

Async and await is an elegant way to handle promises. It is easy to understand and it's clean to write.

```js
const square = async function (n) {
  return n * n
}

square(2)
```

```sh
Promise {<resolved>: 4}
```

The word _async_ in front of a function means that function will return a promise. The above square function instead of a value it returns a promise.

How do we access the value from the promise? To access the value from the promise, we will use the keyword _await_.

```js
const square = async function (n) {
  return n * n
}
const value = await square(2)
console.log(value)
```

```sh
4
```

Now, as you can see from the above example writing async in front of a function create a promise and to get the value from a promise we use await. Async and await go together, one can not exist without the other.

Let us fetch API data using both promise method and async and await method.

- promise

```js
const url = 'https://restcountries.com/v2/all'
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data)
  })
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```

- async and await

```js
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url)
    const countries = await response.json()
    console.log(countries)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
}
console.log('===== async and await')
fetchData()
```
