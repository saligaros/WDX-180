### Study Plan

  - [Watch: **HTML vs DOM? Letâ€™s debug them**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-02VNxE7lE) to understand the basic difference between these two very crucial concepts in Web Development and start building an intuition around the Document Object Model (DOM).
    - **Duration:** 5min
    - **Level:** Beginner

  - **Practice time!** Now that you know the difference between HTML and the DOM, and got a first test of working with the DOM using the `DevTools`, it's time to practice those skills and become comfortable with DOM manipulation.
    - Go through this [**document**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/) and stop at each section to practice the command or tool described in your browser.
