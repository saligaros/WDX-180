  - [Watch: **HTML vs DOM? Letâ€™s debug them**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-02VNxE7lE){:target="_blank"} to understand the basic difference between these two very crucial concepts in Web Development and start building an intuition around the Document Object Model (DOM).
    - **Duration:** 5min
    - **Level:** Beginner

  - **Practice time!** Now that you know the difference between HTML and the DOM, and got a first test of working with the DOM using the `DevTools`, it's time to practice those skills and become comfortable with DOM manipulation.
    - Go through this [**document**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/){:target="_blank"} and stop at each section to practice the command or tool described in your browser.
  
  <!-- TODO: Integrate into the curriculum (as a Module?): https://github.com/GoogleChrome/developer.chrome.com/blob/main/site/en/docs/devtools/dom/index.md -->

  <!-- TODO: Review + Add Practice -->
  - Watch lessons 1-7* from [**JavaScript DOM Manipulation Mastery: A Comprehensive Guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGkc6dKUZ84){:target="_blank"} and try to replicate as much as you can in your local environment.
    - **Duration:** 65min
    - **Level:** Intermediate

  _*up to `LESSON 8: DOM EVENT BASICS` section, around 01:04:46_
