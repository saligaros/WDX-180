### Study Plan

  - [Watch: **How To Make A Website With Tailwind CSS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eQwgc9nc64){:target="_blank"}
    - **Duration:** 32min
    - **Level:** Beginner

  - Now, go through the video again, pause and code along. Below, you can find all the images needed to complete the tutorial _(just click the links, then right click and select "Save Image as")_:
    - [**cart.png**](./assets/cart.png){:target="_blank"}
    - [**grocery-image.png**](./assets/grocery-image.png){:target="_blank"}
    - [**Image.png**](./assets/Image.png){:target="_blank"}
    - [**logo.png**](./assets/logo.png){:target="_blank"}

  You will need to create a repository named **grocify** under your GitHub account and enable GitHub Pages on that. Once you have finished recreating the website in the video, update the progress sheet with your GitHub repository's Pages URL, that would look something like this: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/grocify`

  While working with Tailwind CSS, it's probably a good idea to install the following VSCode extension that will help you deal with the large list of utility classes provided by the library:
