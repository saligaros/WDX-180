/*

  JavaScript Loops

  Challenge:

  -> declare two variables, "character" and "timesToRepeat"
  -> using a loop, repeat each character that many times
  -> console.log the output

  example:  if I had character = 'f' and timesToRepeat = 5, it'd console.log 'fffff'

  Try a few different combinations to make sure you got it right e.g. 'a' and 10, 'c' and 100, '🐶' and 3.
